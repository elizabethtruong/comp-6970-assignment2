        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <h2><a href="hobby1.html">Climbing</a></h2>
        Bouldering is a hobby I recently picked up, and it's been very enjoyable so far. I like to watch climbing technique videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CatalystClimbing">Catalyst Climbing</a>, so I can improve in the gym.
        <h2><a href="hobby2.html">Learning Japanese</a></h2>
        Learning the Japanese language has been a hobby of mine for years now, but I have been taking it more seriously lately. The program <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is useful for memorizing vocabulary and kanji.
