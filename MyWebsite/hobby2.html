        <h1>Learning Japanese</h1>
        I first picked up learning the Japanese language back when I was in middle school. I didn't get far - only learning the first 2 alphabets and some grammar points.
        However when I attended Auburn for undergrad, I enrolled in Japanese classes in hopes of learning again. I enjoyed the classes very much and ended up getting a minor in
        Asian Studies with a concentration in Japanese. Unfortunately after graduating, I did not get many opportunities to practice Japanese so I had lost much of it. Fortunately
        in 2025, I had an amazing opportunity to go to Japan with my friends, and this renewed my interest in Japanese since I was able to use my skills there. Since then, I have began studying again and hope to take the 
        JLPT test this year.
